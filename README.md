# BootcampProject1

The EPA's Air Quality Index AQI was aquired through: https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html
To obtain access to the AQI and use this code, sign up with an email and save both the email and the key in a file labeled "config.py" and format the key and email as following:

aqs_api_key = "YOUR_KEY"
email_address = "YOUR_EMAIL"

The EPA AQI webpage provided, gives detail in how to manage specific pull parameters such as Pollutant being tracked, time frame, and location.

This project forcused on finding the change of the AQI due to the impact of Covid. To further solidify this study, it would be preferred and almost
necessary to pull data from more states and look back at a longer time frame. So the study would include more states within the US and would look at 
data over the course of multiple years rather than 1.
